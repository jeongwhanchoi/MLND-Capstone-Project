# MLND-Capstone-Project

## Iceberg Classifier

This is a repository for the capstone project going on in Udacity. The project received data from *Statoil/C-CORE Iceberg Classifier Challenge* at the [Kaggle Competitoin](https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge). The project goal is to distinguish between iceberg and ship from SAR image data from satellites. For this, deep learning will be conducted using CNN model.
